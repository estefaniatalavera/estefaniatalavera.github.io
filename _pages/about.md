I was born in 1990, in Torreperogil, Jaen, within the region of Andalucía (Spain). When I was 9 I moved to Mallorca with my family. At the age of 18, I joined the undergraduate studies of Industrial Engineering, specialized in Industrial Electronics, from the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The subject of Industrial Vision dragged my attention to the computer vision world. In 2012, I moved to Barcelona and joined the M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering, at the Polytechnical University of Catalunya (UPC) and University of Barcelona (UB). It was there when I met Prof. Petia Radeva, with whom I made my first steps into the egocentric vision topic through my master thesis “Towards unsupervised lifelogging video segmentation”.

In February 2015 I started my PhD journey under the supervision of Prof. Nicolai Petkov (RUG) and Prof. Petia Radeva (UB), through the Ubbo Emmius program. During my research studies I proposed several techniques for egocentric images analysis, such as inferred sentiment computation from visual and semantic features extracted from the images, and behavioural patterns analysis by describing routines understood as the repetition of activities. In February 2020 I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Groningen and the University of Barcelona.

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at the Data Management and Biometrics group at the University of Twente. My research interests are in the intersection of computer science and human behaviour understanding.

I try to balance my life by dancing salsa, hanging out with friends, visiting family in Majorca, and travelling around the world.
