I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/dmb/" target="_blank">Data Management and Biometrics group</a> at the University of Twente. My research interests include computer vision, machine learning, and their intersection for human behaviour understanding.

Prior to joining the University of Twente, I was a lecturer and researcher in the <a href="http://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/">Information Systems group</a> at the University of Groningen. I received my PhD in Computer Science in February 2020 from the <a href="http://www.ub.edu/cvub/" target="_blank">University of Barcelona</a> and the <a href="https://www.cs.rug.nl/is/Main/People" target="_blank">University of Groningen</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ub.edu/cvub/petiaradeva/?p=36">Prof. Petia Radeva</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rug.nl/~petkov/">Prof. Nicolai Petkov</a>.
