I was born in 1990, in Torreperogil, Jaen, within the region of Andalucía (Spain). When I was 9 I moved to Mallorca with my family. At the age of 18, I joined the undergraduate studies of Industrial Engineering, specialized in Industrial Electronics, from the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The subject of Industrial Vision dragged my attention to the computer vision world. In 2012, I moved to Barcelona and joined the M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering, at the Polytechnical University of Catalunya (UPC) and University of Barcelona (UB). It was there when I met Prof. Petia Radeva, with whom I made my first steps into the egocentric vision topic through my master thesis "Towards unsupervised lifelogging video segmentation”.

In a hot summer day in Mallorca, August 2014, she received an email from Prof. Nicolai, her application for a 4 years joint PhD with the University of Groningen had been accepted. From February 2015 she started her PhD journey under the supervision of Prof. Nicolai Petkov (RUG) and Prof. Petia Radeva (UB), through the Ubbo Emmius program. During my research studies I proposed several techniques for egocentric images analysis, such as inferred sentiment computation from visual and semantic features extracted from the images, and behavioural patterns analysis by describing routines understood as the repetition of activities. 
 
As of now, I am a PhD in computer science from the University of Groningen and the University of Barcelona. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at the Data Management and Biometrics group at the University of Twente.

I try to balance my life by dancing salsa, hanging out with friends, visiting family in Majorca, and travelling around the world.
