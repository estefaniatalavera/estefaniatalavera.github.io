## Image Processing (MSc - 1st Year)  
∼30 STUDENTS AY 2020/2021
* The course provides insight in the basic concepts of digital image processing, from image acquisition, digitisation, and preprocessing, to image enhancement, compression, restoration, segmentation and description.

## Introduction to Scientific Computing (BSc - 2nd Year)
∼130 STUDENTS AYs 2019/2020 and 2020/2021
* This course focuses on scientific problem solving on topic in the context of a number of real-world applications. The topics I cover are sequence alignment (string algorithms), cellular automata, fractals, tomographic reconstruction, ordinary and partial differential equations.

## Introduction to Machine Learning (BSc - 3rd Year)
∼80 STUDENTS AY 2020/2021
* This course was given together with Prof. Michael Biehl. It was divided in two parts, supervised and unsupervised learning. I focused on the unsupervised part and taught dimensionality reduction, clustering and outlier detection.
