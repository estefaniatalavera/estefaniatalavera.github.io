Department of Computer Science, Feb 2019 - Sept 2021

At RUG I co-lectured the courses Introduction to Intelligent Systems and Introduction to Machine Learning. I also lectured the master course Image Processing and bachelor course Introduction to Scientific Computing. I also did tutoring for the Introduction to Computing Science course which provides a broad introduction to different aspects of Computer Science.

List of courses:

## Image Processing (MSc - 1st Year)  
∼30 STUDENTS AY 2020/2021
* The course provides insight in the basic concepts of digital image processing, from image acquisition, digitisation, and preprocessing, to image enhancement, compression, restoration, segmentation and description.

## Introduction to Scientific Computing (BSc - 2nd Year)
∼130 STUDENTS AYs 2019/2020 and 2020/2021
* This course focuses on scientific problem solving on topic in the context of a number of real-world applications. The topics I cover are sequence alignment (string algorithms), cellular automata, fractals, tomographic reconstruction, ordinary and partial differential equations.

## Introduction to Machine Learning (BSc - 3rd Year)
∼80 STUDENTS AY 2020/2021
* This course was given together with Prof. Michael Biehl. It was divided in two parts, supervised and unsupervised learning. I focused on the unsupervised part and taught dimensionality reduction, clustering and outlier detection.

## Introduction to Intelligent Systems (BSc - 3rd Year)
∼90 STUDENTS AY 2020/2021
* This course was given together with Prof. Michael Biehl. I covered the introduction of concepts such as pattern recognition, Bayes theory, image processing with edge detection and decision trees.

## Introduction to Computer Science (BSc - 1st Year)
TUTOR/MENTOR ∼25 STUDENTS AYs 2019/2020 and 2020/2021
* The tutorials for first-year CS students are aimed at acquiring knowledge, practising skills, and deepening awareness of societal, inter-cultural, and ethical issues involved in computer science.

## Algorithms and Data Structures in C (BSc - 1st Year) 
∼230 STUDENTS AY 2019/2020
* First year course that covers data structures, trees and graphs in C.

## Software Engineering (BSc - 2nd Year)
∼90 STUDENTS AY 2018/2019
* Project-based course where students work in teams to implement a software demanded by a real customer. Students gain knowledge of the different phases of the software engineering lifecycle through Scrum, Agile and teamwork.
